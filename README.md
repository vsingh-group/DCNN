# DCNN
This is the published code for 
Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks for Sequential Manifold-valued Data (ICCV 2019).

The medical dataset cannot be published because of the private issue.

The USF11 dataset is similar to the SPD-SRU in my github.

When running the codes, be sure that run Preprocessed_UCF11.py first.

Then run the manifoldDCNN_forUCF11.py.

The DTI and the ODF is for reference if you have your own datasets.
